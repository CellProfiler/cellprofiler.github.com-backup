          CellProfiler June 3–5
        </h3>

        <p>
          Meet our own lead software developer Lee Kamentsky and learn how to
          contribute to the CellProfiler project at a workshop organized by
          Carolina Wahlby (also one of our own) on 'How to use and make
          additions to open-source software for image processing, analysis, and
          visualization in medicine and microscopy.' June 3-5 at the Centre for
          Image Analysis, Uppsala University, Sweden.
        </p>

        <p>
          Space is limited to twenty participants, so be sure to see <a href=
          "http://www.cb.uu.se/~carolina/SummerSchool2013/">the workshop's

          May 6, 2013 &mdash; CellProfiler tutorial at CYTO 2013
        </h3>

        <p>
          Our own David Logan will be presenting a scientific tutorial on
          CellProfiler at CYTO 2013! Registration for the tutorial is ongoing
          and can be done onsite, subject to seat availability. See <a href=
          'http://cellprofiler.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=3314'>this forum
          post</a> for more information; registration with CYTO for the
          tutorial can be done independently of conference registration.

        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/">Assay
          Guidance Manual</a> is a free, online resource provided by the
          National Institutes of Health to be a compilation of "best practices"
          in assay development for molecular screens. A <a href=
          "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/assayguide/highhttp://d1zymp9ayga15t.cloudfront.net/content/">section</a>
          on the basics of image-based high-content screening (in which
          CellProfiler got a mention) has already been published, and our group
          was asked to put together a section on more advanced methods. The
          contributed chapter has just been posted online and is <a href=

          February 4, 2013 &mdash; Educational exercises added to the Tutorials
          page
        </h3>

        <p>
          We have just added a couple of educational exercises to assist new
          users getting started with CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first is a demonstration of our recently-published <a href=
          "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1984">Worm Toolbox</a>. The second
          provides details on setting up a pipeline in CellProfiler for a
          translocation assay and visualizing the results in CellProfiler
          Analyst.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both are intended to be in-depth resources for biologists using the
          software for the first time, or for educators who want to introduce
          their students to the utility and power of image analysis. To
          download them, go <a href=
