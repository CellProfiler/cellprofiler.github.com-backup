  Impact on human health
</h1>

<p>
  Our CellProfiler software has yielded discoveries in several
  translational projects, some of which may ultimately have a direct
  impact on the treatment of disease. For example, CellProfiler has
  been used to identify several small molecules that are effective in
  treating particular diseases in mouse models. In some cases,
  discoveries made using CellProfiler have even led to planning
  clinical trials in humans, which could directly improve patient
  outcomes. Here we highlight instances that have come to our
  attention. [See also: <a href=

<p>
  The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has claimed the
  lives of over 8,600 people worldwide; the disease currently has no
  approved cure or vaccine. CellProfiler was used to identify
  therapeutic targets within host human macrophages capable of halting
  infection by inhibiting viral uptake via cell surface proteins and
  endosomal trafficking. The <a href=
  "http://www.txbiomed.org/departments/virology/virology-staff-bio/?u=185">
  Davey</a> lab at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute found that
  Tetrandrine, an isolate from Chinese and Japanese herbs but now
  produced synthetically, was especially potent in blocking two-pore
  channels found in endosomes, and preliminary studies showed high
  therapeutic efficacy in mice without obvious side effects.

  Tuberculosis

<p>
  Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of global concern due in part to
  increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacteria. CellProfiler was used in
  a high-throughput screen of bioactive small molecules to identify
  those that inhibited growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
  within host cells by targeting host functions and pathways. Notably,
  among the identified effective compounds were fluoxetine (commonly
  known as Prozac) and gefitinib, used clinically for treating
  depression and cancer, respectively. Gefitinib was subsequently
  demonstrated to reduce Mtb growth in the lungs of infected mice. In
  addition to identifying new pathways likely to be relevant for TB
  pathogenesis, this work demonstrated that targeting the host may be a
  viable adjunctive approach for treating TB.

<p>
  CellProfiler helped to identify novel compounds that may lead to
  potential treatments for a form of leukemia involving human
  megakaryocytes (AMKL). Most cancer treatments work by targeting
  cancer cells for death as compared to normal cells. By contrast, the
  goal here was to search for drugs that can induce polyploidy, which
  restrains the cancerous cellsâ€™ uncontrolled growth by causing them to
  differentiate into a terminal state. Over 200 polyploidization
  regulators were identified from a 10,000 compound screen. One hit in
  particular, dimethylfasudil, a broad kinase inhibitor of Aurora
  kinase A, also succeeded in inducing polyploidy in an AMKL mouse
  model. The team turned its attention to the Aurora-A inhibitor
  Alisertib which is already under clinical investigation for a variety
  of tumors.

<p>
  Cancer treatments directed towards leukemia can often fail due to the
  survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in the bone marrow. The
  researchers screened 14,000 compounds in an unusually complex and
  physiologically relevant in vitro co-culture system involving bone
  marrow stromal cells and primary LSC-enriched cells. CellProfiler was
  used together with the machine-learning capabilities of CellProfiler
  Analyst to find compounds that inhibit LSC growth but do not affect
  normal hematopoietic stem cells. One of the identified compounds was
  lovastatin, a drug commonly used to treat high cholesterol. It
  inhibited LSC growth in the co-culture system, as well as extended
  the survival of mice with lovastatin-treated leukemic bone marrow
  cells.

<p>
  Researchers at the <a href=
  "http://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/molecular-biology-faculty/li/li.php">
  University of Utah</a> used CellProfiler to identify image-based
  phenotypes associated with a monogenic rare disease, the hereditary
  stroke syndrome cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). They then
  identified known drugs that could reverse the phenotype and
  demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of CCM disease. This led to
  the launching of <a href="http://www.recursionpharma.com/">Recursion
  Pharmaceuticals</a>, which is pursuing a clinical trial for a
  compound to treat CCM, which has no currently approved therapy. The
  company will use a similar approach to identify compounds to target
  other rare genetic diseases.
