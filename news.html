  April 30, 2014 &mdash; Impact of CellProfiler on human health
</h3>

<p>
  Our CellProfiler software has yielded discoveries in several
  translational projects, some of which may ultimately have a direct impact
  on the treatment of disease. For example, CellProfiler has been used to
  identify several small molecules that are effective in treating
  particular diseases in mouse models. In some cases, discoveries made
  using CellProfiler have even led to planning clinical trials in humans,
  which could directly improve patient outcomes. [<a href=

  January 24, 2014 &mdash; CellProfiler 2.1.0 release!
</h3>

<p>
  The CellProfiler team is excited to announce the release of CellProfiler
  2.1.0!
</p>

<p>
  In this major update, we have made it easier to load complicated
  collections of images and associated data. The new version is often many
  times faster on computers with multiple CPU cores, so very large sets of
  images can now be processed on a regular personal computer. Memory
  handling is also improved, and there are many new image processing
  options, features, usability enhancements, speed improvements, and bug
  fixes. More details are in the release notes: <a href=

  March 6, 2013 &mdash; Advanced high-content analysis contribution to
  the Assay Guidance Manual now live!
</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/">Assay
  Guidance Manual</a> is a free, online resource provided by the
  National Institutes of Health to be a compilation of "best practices"
  in assay development for molecular screens. A <a href=
  "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/">section</a>
  on the basics of image-based high-content screening (in which
  CellProfiler got a mention) has already been published, and our group
  was asked to put together a section on more advanced methods. The
  contributed chapter has just been posted online and is <a href=

<h3>
  February 4, 2013 &mdash; Educational exercises added to the Tutorials
  page
</h3>

<p>
  We have just added a couple of educational exercises to assist new
  users getting started with CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst.
</p>

<p>
  The first is a demonstration of our recently-published <a href=
  "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1984">Worm Toolbox</a>. The second
  provides details on setting up a pipeline in CellProfiler for a
  translocation assay and visualizing the results in CellProfiler
  Analyst.
</p>

<p>
  Both are intended to be in-depth resources for biologists using the
  software for the first time, or for educators who want to introduce
  their students to the utility and power of image analysis. To
  download them, go <a href=
